# I Love LuCI Route Inventory

Generated from `ubus call luci.iloveluci menu_tree` on router `172.16.172.1`.

This inventory records the current user-facing renderer decision for every visible LuCI menu route on the test router. `Native` routes expose an I Love LuCI `nativePath`; `LuCI compat` routes open the LuCI compatibility frame and must keep full legacy behavior until native parity is proven.
